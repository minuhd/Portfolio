#Beading App  
The code in the file is meant to create the very basic interface of a beading designs application. 
Beading is the art of creating anything from bracelets, to necklaces and even purses out of beads, however it is not limited to only these examples. Anything the imagination can create. 
The application is supposed to bring to your disposal a canvas on which a grid is drawn and where the user can color the rectangles of the grid in any color chosen by him from a color pallete, in both portrait and landscape mode. 
The application also has a saving function. 
It consists of a main menu with the buttons for Portraid and Landscape mode and within one of these modes, there's a button for the color pallete as well as the button to save the pattern. 
The application is stil a work in progress and far from being released to the public, it is only meant as a beginner project.
